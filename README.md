# pata-password-cracker
Password cracker that implements patadata toolkit and other
metaphysical and psychological techniques.


This tools allows you to add an arbitary list of YAML key
value pairs to generate potential passwords from.

These would typically be biographical/georgraphical data
of the target. 

For example:

pet_name: biggles

hobby: football

The tool is agnostic so any key value pair you consider
worthy of attempting is valid.

In addition to this will be 4 fixed categories these being:

1. Family-oriented

2. Fans

3. Fantasists

4. Cryptic


Values provided in these categories can have
additional processing applied to them. 

The names were derived from the categories 
that Dr Helen Petrie defined in her work back in
the early naughties.

This is still in early stages of development......
